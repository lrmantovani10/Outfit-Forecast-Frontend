# Outfit Forecast

Outfit Forecast is an app designed to make choosing weather appropriate outfits easy. Using the user's location and images of their wardrobe, our app recommends outfits with the weather in mind.  

## Running Outfit Forecast

1. Clone the repo locally

```git clone https://github.com/LukeKnutson9/Outfit-Forecast-Frontend.git ```

2. Download ***Expo Go*** on your mobile device.
3. In the root folder ```Outfit-Forecast-Frontend``` run:
* ```npm install``` to install dependencies
* ```npx expo start``` to start the server
4. You can either scan the QR code that appears in the terminal window, or open Expo Go and select ```Outfit-Forecast-Frontend```
5. With Expo Go running Outfit Forecast, you can start using the app. If you haven't used the app before, there will be no clothes associated with your userID. Take or upload some pictures of your clothes to build your wardrobe and get predictions!

## Functionality

At its core, Outfit Forecast is designed to take the guesswork out of what you should wear every day. Using the weather at your location and images of your wardrobe, Outfit Forecast will recommend temperature appropriate outfits for you to wear.
 
To begin using the app, go to your Wardrobe and take pictures of a variety of clothes from your wardrobe. Try to use pictures taken against a blank background with good lighting. We recommend uploading 8-10 articles of clothing to startâ€”if you decline an outfit, the app will recommend a completely new outfit, so it's good to have multiples of clothing types (ie three shirts, two jackets, 3 pairs of pants, etc). From there, you can set temperature ranges for the clothes you have uploaded, and get recommendations! 

## General Tips
- If trying to identify shoes, try to take a photo of a pair of shoes instead of just one
- Try not to be wearing the clothing you photograph
- Try to take photos over a plain/white background to prevent other objects from interfering with classification
